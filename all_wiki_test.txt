* Sailors were long-known to especially value polydactyl cats (which have extra toes as a genetic trait) for their extraordinary climbing and hunting abilities as an aid in controlling shipboard rodents.
Some sailors also considered them to be extremely good luck when at sea.
Hemingway was one of the more famous lovers of polydactyl cats.
He was first given a six-toed cat by a ship's captain.
As provided in his will, his former home in Key West, Florida (which is now a popular museum) currently houses approximately sixty descendents of his cats, approximately 50% of whom are polydactyl.

Roman Jakobson was integral to its development.
Jakobson recognized the value of Saussure's theories to Russian language because of the application of Marxism and the worth accorded to literature in Russian society as a means of moral and social criticism.
During World War II, Jakobson emigrated to the U.S. and brought his passion for Saussure with him.
He founded the New York Circle and a new Journal (&quot;Word&quot;) and presented a series of lectures and articles on the Cours.
He also began to encourage North American comprehension and acceptance of Saussure that would finally take root in the 50's and 60's as a more open climate between the North American and European academic communities was actualized.

A phone is a sound that has a definite shape as a sound wave, while a phoneme is a basic group of sounds that can distinguish words (i.e.
changing one phoneme in a word can produce another word); speakers of a particular language perceive a phoneme as a single distinctive sound in that language.
Thus an allophone is a phone considered as a member of one phoneme.
Internally, the &quot;Sigurimi&quot; Albanian secret police made sure to replicate the repressive methods of the KGB and Stasi.
Its activities permeated Albanian society to the extent that every third citizen had either served time in labor camps or been interrogated by Sigurimi officers.
To eliminate dissent, the government resorted systematically to purges, in which opponents were dismissed from their jobs, imprisoned in forced-labour camps, and often executed.
Travel abroad was forbidden to all but those on official business, in order to sustain the myth of an advanced Albania.
Any trace of individuality and creativity in cultural life was stifled, as the arts and belles lettres were allowed to exist only to the degree they served as mouthpieces for the government.
